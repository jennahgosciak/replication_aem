# Replication Exercise for Advanced Empirical Methods

Stata code is meant to replicate the findings from the Angrist and Evans paper [Children and Their Parents' Labor Supply: Evidence from Exogeneous Variation in Family Size](https://www.jstor.org/stable/116844)
* [submission1](https://github.com/jennahgosciak/replication_aem/tree/main/submission1): results from the final submission.
* [01_produce_datafile.do](https://github.com/jennahgosciak/replication_aem/blob/main/Programs/01_produce_datafile.do): cleaning and reshaping the data. Produces the output for tables 2, 6, and 7 in the Angrist and Evans report.
* [01_produce_datafile.log](https://github.com/jennahgosciak/replication_aem/blob/main/Programs/01_produce_datafile.log): accompanying Stata logfile.
